# MongoDB $inc Operator Usage Error
This repository demonstrates an example of an uncommon error related to the `$inc` operator in MongoDB update operations.

The `$inc` operator is used to increment or decrement a numeric field in a document. However, attempting to increment with a non-numeric value results in an error or unexpected behavior.

The `bug.js` file shows the incorrect implementation, while `bugSolution.js` demonstrates the corrected version.
